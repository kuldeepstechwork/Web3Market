# Web3Market

Web3Market is a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain, offering a unique platform for buying and selling items using cryptocurrency. Inspired by the popular Craigslist model, Web3Market takes it a step further by enabling users to not only list items for sale but also make purchases directly on the website using cryptocurrency.

## Features

- **Ethereum Smart Contracts:** The foundation of Web3Market is built upon Ethereum smart contracts, developed using the Solidity programming language. These smart contracts ensure secure and transparent transactions between buyers and sellers.

- **Test-Driven Development:** I follow a comprehensive test-driven development approach, leveraging JavaScript to create thorough tests for the smart contracts. This ensures the functionality, reliability, and robustness of the platform.

- **Blockchain Deployment:** The smart contracts developed for Web3Market are deployed onto a blockchain network, providing a decentralized infrastructure for users to interact with the marketplace.

- **Client-side Website:** To facilitate seamless communication between users and the smart contracts, I create a user-friendly client-side website using Web3.js and React.js. This interface allows users to easily list items, browse listings, and complete transactions using cryptocurrency.

## Technologies Used

- **Ganache Personal Blockchain:** I utilize Ganache as a personal blockchain for local development and testing purposes.

- **Node.js:** Node.js is used as the runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution.

- **Truffle Framework:** Truffle Framework serves as the development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts.

- **Metamask Ethereum Wallet:** I integrate Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet, to provide users with a secure and convenient way to manage their cryptocurrency and engage in transactions.
